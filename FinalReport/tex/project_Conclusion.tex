\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented a prototype design for a distributed \clientServer system that has a communication structure similar to a \ptoP model. The system supports a real-time online multiplayer game with distributed state.
The design gracefully handles node failure without inducing any game play suspension. 
The system demonstrates promise in its ability to scale in the number of nodes with respect to the consistency of the system. 

\noindent \textbf{Limitations}
The system can suffer from DOS attacks by nodes that have a desire to reject fire messages.
There is also a significant amount of messaging in the system due to the \ptoP structure between nodes.

\noindent \textbf{Future Work}
The scalability of the system could be further improved by using a spatial partitioning scheme that would limit the number of relevant nodes each node should keep track of.
There are additional methods that could be used to protect against malicious clients. 
One example is to encrypt the messages sent to nodes. 
This way a malicious client won't know which messages are being ignored, in-turn that client's own information will be out of date and rejected by other nodes.
Another option is to send fire messages to all, or a random subset, of nodes and have the majority determine the outcome of the action.
