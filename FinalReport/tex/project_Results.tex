\label{sec:evaluation}

We plan to evaluate our method in two ways. Primarily, the methods ability to handle failure. To cope with the failure gracefully and cause the least amount of disturbance in the gameplay as possible. A secondary goal is to keep the latency of the game down as more clients and server are added to the system.
