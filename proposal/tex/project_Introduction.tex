We propose to construct a distributed \clientServer model in order to gracefully handle fail-stop scenarios. We will use this system to support a simple computer game of a number of agents moving around in a 2D world. We assume no limits on bandwidth and have strong constraints on latency which significantly impacts online game experience~\cite{Claypool:2006:LPA:1167838.1167860}.
