We propose to construct a distributed \clientServer in order to support fail-stop scenarios. We assume no limits on bandwidth and have strong constraints on latency which is considered one of the most important parts of game experience~\cite{Claypool:2006:LPA:1167838.1167860}. We will use this system to support a simple computer game of a number of agents moving around in a 2D world.
