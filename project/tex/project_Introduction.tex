Some awesome intro stuff.

In online real time multi-player games (like Battlefield, Call of duty or Halo) the current approach is to use a client/server model. The client/server model provides the best solution for two common problems in this area latency and cheating. Latency is reduced because the clients interact with the server so the game is only as slow as the client-server connection. To handle cheating the server simulates the game itself and acts as the authoritative figure over the game state. Latency is in part the most difficult problem to overcome in real-time systems and has the largest effect on the clientâ€™s experience.

\todo{Maybe we can focus on fail-stop failure and not fail-crash.}
